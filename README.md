# TipCalculator
iOS Tip Calculator

This project was a prework assignment for the codepath iOS development course.

The purpose of this project was to build a tip calculator app which allows a user to calculate the tip and total amount from any particular bill based on their desired tip percentage. There's also an option to change the currency if they're located within a different country.
